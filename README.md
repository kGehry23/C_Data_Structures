# C_Data_Structures

Implementation of the basic data structures written in C. All implementations include support for stored integer values, however, the aim is to make the type parameters generic.

The Data_Structures folder includes implementations of:

    1. Linked Lists -> Singly Linked
    2. Stacks -> Classic Linked Implementation
    2. Queues -> Classic Linked Implementation
